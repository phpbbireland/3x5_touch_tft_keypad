An LCD/TFT (Makerfabs-ESP32-S3-SPI-TFT-with-Touch), an Image (320x240px) including 16 icons (buttons) and
a Text file with 16 lines of text...
  
Basically we simply use a predesigned 320x240 image containging 16 icons (one for each key)
and map the their position to touch actions...
  
We load the image and read the text file (menu actions) from SD card and that's it...

The text file consists of 15 lines, each containg the actual characters we need to send to the computer...
Special keys: [ALT], [SHIFT], [CTRL], [SUPER], [SPACE], [TAB], [F1 - [F24]...
  
Each line can contain:  
   A program name (can include the path) to launch, for example: ~/{HOME}/this_path/this_program
   Special key combinations: [ALT]{3} or [CTRL][F10] or [SHIFT][CTRL][ALT]{g}
   Any combination of keys up to 128 characters...
